            Imagine if you could <span className="PColor">Automate</span>  sending money to people you usually
            send money to on a regular basis. Say your mother, father, siblings
            or your girlfriend. This app saves you the stress of manually
            sending them money on a set basis and not forgetting to do so so
            everyone is happy.

            This feature is the main catch for the app. But it can also serve as
            an <span className="Bold">Automated Subscription</span>  service; for those of us that would like
            to subscribe to say Spectranet or data on a regs or even DSTV or
            Netflix.
